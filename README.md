# Bootstrap a React ArcGIS Typescript App

This is a simple boilerplate to start with ArcGIS and React.

This based on the [arcgis-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin) and this [webpack example](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/4.x/webpack)

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:othke/arcgis-react-ts.git
```

## How to

```bash
npm run dev # webpack dev server reloading (no HMR)
npm run build # get the build distribution
npm run serve # run production like with webpack dev server
```
